/**
 * This API can be used to selectively advertise your multiplayer game session in a Steam chat room group. Tell Steam the number of player spots that are available for your party, and a join-game string, and it will
 * show a beacon in the selected group and allow that many users to �follow� the beacon to your party. Adjust the number of open slots if other players join through alternate matchmaking methods.
 * For example, you can use ISteamParties in conjunction with a private lobby. Create a private lobby, and then use ISteamParties::CreateBeacon to create a party "beacon" for the number of players desired. The game
 * connect string should indicate the ID of the private lobby.
 * The beacon will appear in Steam in the specified location (e.g. a Chat Room Group), and also via the in-game ISteamParties API as described below. Steam creates "reservation" slots for the number of desired players.
 * Whenever a user follows the beacon, Steam will hold a reservation slot for them and launch the game using the given connect string.
 * The game session that created the beacon will be notified of this reservation, so the game can display the appropriate "User <username> is joining your party" or some other indicator. Once the user joins successfully,
 * the game session should call ISteamParties::OnReservationCompleted to tell Steam that the user successfully joined (otherwise, Steam will eventually timeout their reservation and re-open the slot).
 * When all of the beacon slots are occupied - either by reservations for users still launching the game, or completed slots for users in the party - Steam will hide and disable the beacon.
 * To cancel the beacon - for instance when the party is full and the game begins - call ISteamParties::DestroyBeacon.
 * The client side of this operation - seeing and following beacons - can also be managed by your game. Using ISteamParties::GetNumActiveBeacons and ISteamParties::GetBeaconDetails, your game can get a list of beacons
 * from other users that are currently active in locations relevant to the current user. If the user desires, call ISteamParties::JoinParty to "follow" one of those beacons.
