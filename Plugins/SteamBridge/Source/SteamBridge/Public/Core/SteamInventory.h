	 * Trigger an item drop if the user has played a long enough period of time.
	 * This period can be customized in two places:
	 * At the application level within Inventory Service: Playtime Item Grants. This will automatically apply to all "playtimegenerator" items that do not specify any overrides.
	 * In an individual "playtimegenerator" item definition. The settings would take precedence over any application-level settings.
	 * Only item definitions which are marked as "playtime item generators" can be spawned.
	 * Typically this function should be called at the end of a game or level or match or any point of significance in the game in which an item drop could occur. The granularity of the playtime generator settings is -
	 * in minutes, so calling it more frequently than minutes is not useful and will be rate limited in the Steam client. The Steam servers will perform playtime accounting to prevent too-frequent drops. The servers -
	 * will also manage adding the item to the players inventory.
	 *
	 * NOTE: You must call DestroyResult on the provided inventory result when you are done with it.
	 *
	 * @param FSteamInventoryResult & ResultHandle - Returns a new inventory result handle.
	 * @param FSteamItemDef DropListDefinition - This must refer to an itemdefid of the type "playtimegenerator". See the inventory schema for more details.
	 * @return bool - This function always returns true when called by a regular user, and always returns false when called from SteamGameServer.
	 * Returns a new result handle via pResultHandle.
	 * The inventory result returned by this function will be the new item granted if the player is eligible. If the user is not eligible then it will return an empty result ('[]').
