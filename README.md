# ProjectApollo

Utilizing the CheekyFPS project as a base, this project serves as my study for level design and AI Perception.

## Goals for the project

- AI can react to player actions (shot out lights, thrown objects, etc)
- At least 3 levels that grow from small and linear but focused, to large and open ended
- Implementing grenades and other thrown objects
- Dynamic lighting system


## Currently Implemented Features
- AI Perception that can detect the player, react to auditory stimulus (footsteps)
- Basic weapon system (player and AI can fire and reload, but only two weapons implemented)
- All features from [CheekyFPS](https://github.com/DaveFace/CheekyFPS) as of 11/09/2020

## Stretch goals
- Generic VO for player and AI, BGM
- Plot???

## Getting Started
This project is *mainly* based in Blueprint but some AI features and other lower level systems require C++ programming.

I have tried to stick to [Allar's fantastic style guide](https://github.com/Allar/ue4-style-guide), at least where it comes to asset naming conventions.
